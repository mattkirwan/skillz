		<h1>Skillz</h1>

		<h2>Use your skills to better your skills.</h2>

		<p>The world is made up of givers and receivers, skillz aims to level that playing field by providing a platform to give your skills and in return receive the skills of others on a topic that you want to know more about.</p>

		<p>The idea is simple.</p>

		<p>A giver posts a skill with which they would be willing to provide a one-to-one lesson on, it could be anything from how to bake the perfect victoria sponge cake through to an in-depth look at particle physics.</p>

		<p>We index your skill and allow a receiver who may just want to take their sponge cakes to the next level get in touch with that giver and claim their skill.</p>

		<p>There is a catch.</p>

		<p>For a receiver to claim a skill they first need to earn skill points by you guessed it...giving.</p>

		<p>Skill points are time-based, if you provide 4 hours of giving you receive 4 points with which you can trade for the equivalent time receiving an available topic.</p>

		<p>Once you have claimed a skill and are ready to receive, we hook you up with your giver and let you work out the finer details of your skillz meet.</p>

		<p>Essentially we are pimps for your brain.</p>
