<h3>Some points</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Skillz meets should ideally not be monetary based (maybe receiver buys lunch but token gestures)</li>
	<li>Once a connection is made, it's  up to the two parties entirely.</li>
	<li>Skillz meets are review, feedback received and some kind of ranking for the user.</li>
